## Setup:

1. Run `. setup.sh`

## Change the commit

You are working really hard on the master branch. Part of your work is already committed. This is when your boss comes in with an urgent request.

Since your current HEAD is not ready for prime time you backup one commit, and start a new branch named 'quickfix'. You do whatever your boss wants and commit the changes to that new branch.

That's when you realize you created a minor mess with your branches.

The master branch should have the following order of commits after this exercise

```
Initial Commit
Make quick fix - should be moved to master
Added important code
```

## Steps/Task

1. Fix the master branch so that it has commits in the order
